LM hashes was disabled at 2008 server, but them has a limit of 14 chars, and if the pass has more than 7, it divides in 2 blocks and encrypts separately wih DES.
To run Mimikatz as Admin and read the LSASS (wich need sys rights), we need to have a user with SeDebugPrivilege.
To use Mimi TokenElevationFunction we need SeImpersonatePrivilege (like local admins by default).

# Get Local users:
Get-LocalUser

sudo hashcat -m 1000 hashes /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
