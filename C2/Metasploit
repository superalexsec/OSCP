# Check workspaces:
msf6 > workspace
* default
# Add workspace:
msf6 > workspace -a offsec
[*] Added workspace: offsec
[*] Workspace: offsec

# We can use DB_NMap tool to store info about the pentest:
msf6 > db_nmap -A 10.0.0.1

# Now we can check hosts:
msf6 > hosts

# Now we can check services:
msf6 > services
# Optionally we can select ports:
msf6 > services -p 445

# set as RHosts all services with port 445:
services -p 445 --rhosts

# Check for creds already bruteforced:
