# We can try to run the service bin and see called DLLs on ProcMon, if there is missing ones, we can try to write on some dirs to get code executed. In ProcMon we nee to filter Process Name is XPTO.exe.

# Standard DLL search order 
1. The directory from which the application loaded.
2. The system directory.
3. The 16-bit system directory.
4. The Windows directory. 
5. The current directory.
6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.
# When safe DLL search mode is disabled, the current directory is searched at position 2 after the application's directory.

# DLL in C code:
=============================
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <windows.h>

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(
HANDLE hModule,// Handler
DWORD ul_reason_for_call,// Reason
