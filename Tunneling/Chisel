CAN START TUNNEL ON REMOTE KALI
Chisel will create a reverse SSH Tunnel connecting from TARGET in direction to KALI:8080, to bypass firewall rules, using SOCKS.
Inside KALI a port 1080 will be created to route the packets through SSH ProxyCommand, to a machine with Internal IP Address. NEED NCAT: Ncat will pass %H and %P as host and port.
